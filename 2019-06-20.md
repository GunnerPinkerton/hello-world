   Last night I got through about 30 minutes of week 1 of CS50. Previously I have watched and completed the project for week 0. My Scratch project is a simple 3 choice fantasy game where an elf chooses one of three magical items, accompanied by a wizard in a dark forest. 
   
   The most challenging portion of the project was coordinating the multiple scripts for each sprite to synchronize when events happened. That was also the most rewarding aspect, having the "ah-ha" moments of getting the scripts to run properly. I did have to temper my expectation for the project. I wanted to have the other relics dismissed after a brief dialogue and then have the relic react to the elf based upon a unique property for each. With time and experience, I will go back and update the project to achieve that vision. But at this point, I need to focus on getting through the rest of the material.
   
   The portion of the lecture I viewed last night emphasized logical thinking and removing assumption and abstraction. I'm looking forward to learning more about the C language and toying around with it in the CS50 Sandbox. I think a good exercise for practicing logical thinking and removing abstraction would be creating a pseudo-code for the avocado toast I made this morning.

    0 Go to Pantry
    1 Turn knob 90 degrees clockwise
    2 Pull pantry door
    3 Release knob
    4 Locate bread
    5 Locate avocado
    6 Take bread
    7 Take avocado
    8 Place both on counter
    9 Locate toaster
    10 Plug toaster cord into wall socket
    11 Set power knob to 3
    12 Untie bread bag
    13 Open bread bag
    14 Grab two slices of bread
    15 If the heel was grabbed, then return it to the loaf and grab a slice that isn't the heel
    16 Place two slices of bread vertically in the toaster parallel to the slots in the top of the toaster
    17 Push down on the front button to begin toasting
    18 Pull utensil drawer open
    19 Locate steak knives
    20 Take 1 steak knife
    21 Push utensil drawer closed
    22 Grab knife by handle
    23 Grab avocado
    24 Cut avocado in half using knife with the sharp edge facing toward avocado
    25 When the knife reaches the pit of the avocado, rotate the avocado around the knife in a striaght line to cut in half
    26 Place both halves of the avocado and the knife on the counter
    27 Pick up the half with the pit
    28 Remove the avocado pit and place the avocado half back on the counter
    29 Throw away the pit
    30 Place the knife in the sink
    31 Take bread
    32 Tie bread bag closed
    33 Place bread in pantry
    34 Close pantry door
    35 Open dishes cabinet
    36 Take one plate
    37 Place plate on counter
    38 Close dishes cabinet
    39 Pull open the utensil drawer
    40 Take spoon
    41 Push closed the utensil drawer
    42 Place spoon on counter
    43 Take toasted bread from toaster
    44 Place slices of toast side by side on plate
    45 Scoop avocado flesh from one avocado half
    46 Spread face up on one slice of toast
    47 Scoop avocado flesh from the remaining avocado half
    48 Spread face up on the other slice of toast
    49 Place the spoon in the sink
    50 Throw away the avocado shells
    51 Eat the avocado toast
    52 Place the plate in the sink
    
 52 steps later, I have made, eaten, and put away two slices of avocado toast. i didn't get to season them, but sometimes breakfast has to be made quick. Even having gone through this process and making myself remove abstraction and assumptions, I'm positive there are still some oversights, such as placing items on the counter as opposed to specific and non-overlapping positions.
