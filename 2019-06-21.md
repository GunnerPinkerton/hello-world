Last night I wasn't able to get into anymore of the CS50 material. I was able to send my Scratch project to a couple friends. They liked it, and they said they wished there was more of the project available. That is certainly a motivating feeling. I also showed the project to my girlfriend and she liked it a lot! Having vocal support like that reassures me that I'm on the right path! 

Today at work there's a competition for early release, so I may be able to head home earlier and use that extra time to focus on week one's lecture. My plan this weekend is to finish the lecture and start on the assignment. Depending on the size and the skill, my hope is to have it completed by the middle of next week.
